# MPD, Volumio, RuneAudio OLED Spectrum Display for Raspberry Pi

The mpd_oled program displays an information screen including a music
frequency spectrum on an OLED screen connected to a Raspberry Pi running
MPD, like Volumio or RuneAudio (and a time display when no music is playing).

The code and installation instructions have not been widely tested. The
program supports a variety of I2C and SPI 128x64 OLED displays, but I only
have access to a 4-pin I2C SSH1106 OLED with a Raspberry Pi Zero W for
testing.

## Build and install

The instructions depend on the player

* [Build and install on Volumio](INSTALL_VOLUMIO.md)
* [Build and install on RuneAudio](INSTALL_RUNEAUDIO.md)
* Build and install on Debian-based OS running MPD, follow the instructions
  for [Build and install on Volumio](INSTALL_VOLUMIO.md) but use
  `PLAYER=MPD make` when building mpd_oled
